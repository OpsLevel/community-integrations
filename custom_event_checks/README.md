# Custom Event Check Library

## Overview
OpsLevel's [Custom Event Checks](https://docs.opslevel.com/docs/custom-event-checks) accept arbitrary JSON payloads from any third party platform to create custom, data-driven checks.

The JSON payloads are:
* parsed and mapped to the corresponding Services in your OpsLevel account
* evaluated against your custom conditions to determine if a Service has passed or failed the Check
