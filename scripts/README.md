# Custom Scripts Library

## Overview
Custom code written by our customers for the purpose of integrating with OpsLevel. For example, you might find scripts for importing service dependency mapping from a third party tool, extending our Jira integration to automatically create Jira tickets from Campaign Checks, or populating your software catalog with infrastructure resources from GCP.
